## Execution Strategy

### Dependency Flow
```
┌─── Task 1 (PDF Testing) ────┐
│                             │
├─── Task 2 (Foundation) ─────┼──> Task 3 (Processors) ──> Task 4 (Integration) ──┬──> Task 5 (Testing)
│                             │                                                    │
└─────────────────────────────┘                                                    └──> Task 6 (Docs)
```

### Parallel Execution Opportunities
- **Phase 1**: Tasks 1 & 2 execute in parallel
- **Phase 2**: Task 3 after both complete
- **Phase 3**: Task 4 after Task 3
- **Phase 4**: Tasks 5 & 6 in parallel after Task 4

---

## Context Loading Summary

Each task includes comprehensive @ context references:

1. **Primary References**:
   - @genie/wishes/knowledge-enhancement-wish.md
   - @genie/reports/forge-plan-knowledge-enhancement-202510141240.md

2. **Architecture Context**:
   - @CLAUDE.md (project patterns)
   - @lib/knowledge/CLAUDE.md (knowledge architecture)
   - @lib/knowledge/row_based_csv_knowledge.py (current implementation)

3. **Cross-Task References**:
   - Task 3 references Task 1 results for PDF library
   - Task 4 references Task 2 models and Task 3 processors
   - Tasks 5 & 6 reference all implementation tasks

---

## Critical Success Factors

### Technical Requirements
✅ PDF library selection based on A/B testing data
✅ TDD approach for all processors (tests first)
✅ >85% test coverage across new code
✅ Performance: 100 docs <10s, <500MB memory
✅ Brazilian Portuguese support throughout
✅ CSV knowledge 100% preserved

### Configuration Architecture
✅ Dedicated YAML config file (not in agent configs)
✅ User-configurable entity extraction
✅ Business unit auto-detection
✅ Environment variable overrides
✅ Global feature toggle

### Quality Gates
✅ All tests passing before marking complete
✅ Performance benchmarks met
✅ Documentation comprehensive
✅ Migration guide included

## Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks
1. **CSV Breakage**: Mitigated by strict detection logic and comprehensive tests
2. **Performance**: Parallel processing and benchmarking in Task 5
3. **Complexity**: Zen tools available for Tasks 3 & 4
4. **Integration**: Careful _load_content override with safety checks

### Protection Boundaries
- ❌ Never modify Agno's base classes
- ❌ Never break CSV knowledge loading
- ❌ Never hardcode processing rules
- ❌ Never skip TDD workflow
- ❌ Never bulk reprocess existing documents

## Agent Instructions

### For hive-coder (Tasks 1-4, 6)
1. Load all @ referenced files before starting
2. Follow TDD for processors (Task 3)
3. Use selected PDF library from Task 1 in Task 3
4. Ensure CSV preservation in Task 4
5. Test all documentation examples in Task 6

### For hive-tests (Task 5)
1. Achieve >85% coverage for all new code
2. Test Brazilian Portuguese content thoroughly
3. Validate performance targets
4. Include edge cases and error scenarios
5. Ensure no flaky tests

- [ ] All @ context files loaded and analyzed
- [ ] Success criteria from task spec met
- [ ] Tests written and passing (where applicable)
- [ ] Performance targets validated
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Death Testament created with evidence
- [ ] Commit includes co-author attribution

---

## Human Follow-Up Actions

After task creation:

1. **Monitor Execution**: Track agent progress through Death Testaments
2. **Review Deliverables**: Validate each task's output meets requirements
3. **Integration Testing**: Run full E2E tests after Task 4
4. **Performance Validation**: Confirm benchmarks after Task 5
5. **Documentation Review**: Verify completeness after Task 6
6. **Merge Preparation**: Create PR after all tasks complete

## Death Testament Requirements

Each agent must deliver Death Testament documenting:
- Implementation details
- Test results and coverage
- Performance metrics
- Known issues or limitations
- Integration notes for dependent tasks
