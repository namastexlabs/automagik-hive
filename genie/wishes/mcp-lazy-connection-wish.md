# üßû MCP LAZY CONNECTION WISH

**Status:** DRAFT

## Executive Summary
Ensure MCP-backed tools reconnect on demand so agents can reliably execute remote documentation searches without event-loop failures.

## Current State Analysis
**What exists:** `lib/utils/proxy_agents.py` eagerly connects every MCP server during agent fabrication and keeps the session object on the toolkit.
**Gap identified:** When the underlying loop restarts (uvicorn, CLI runs, etc.) those pre-opened sessions become invalid, leading to `RuntimeError: Event loop is closed` once a tool is actually invoked.
**Solution approach:** Store connection parameters at creation time, defer the real connection until tool-call execution, and guarantee clean teardown plus informative error propagation.

## Change Isolation Strategy
- **Isolation principle:** Encapsulate all lifecycle updates inside `lib/utils/proxy_agents.py` and supporting MCP helpers so higher layers only see a sturdier toolkit surface.
- **Extension pattern:** Add reconnection helpers that wrap existing include/exclude filtering rather than rewriting registries or catalog loading.
- **Stability assurance:** Preserve today‚Äôs YAML parsing outputs and tool-list metadata so previously working MCP servers keep functioning unchanged.

## Success Criteria
‚úÖ Template agent lists MCP tools and successfully calls `resolve-library-id` even after multiple runs in the same process.
‚úÖ First-time failures report actionable HTTP or transport details instead of hanging or returning generic loop errors.
‚úÖ Calling code no longer opens persistent MCP sessions during agent boot, avoiding unnecessary resource usage.
‚úÖ Unit and integration tests cover both healthy and failing MCP responses with deterministic behaviour.

## Never Do (Protection Boundaries)
‚ùå Modify `.mcp.json` defaults or rename existing MCP server entries.
‚ùå Strip out granular tool filtering (`include_tools` semantics) when refactoring wrappers.
‚ùå Introduce direct subprocess calls for reconnection that bypass the existing MCP client API.

## Technical Architecture

### Component Structure
- `lib/utils/proxy_agents.py` ‚Äî central orchestrator that produces Agno agents and merges MCP toolkits.
- `lib/mcp/connection_manager.py` ‚Äî catalog-aware connection helper for MCP servers (read-only context reference).
- `lib/mcp/catalog.py` ‚Äî supplies server configuration (no behavioural changes expected beyond read access).
- `tests/lib/utils/test_proxy_agents_coverage.py` ‚Äî regression harness ensuring proxy behaviour remains consistent.
- `tests/integration/test_agents_real_execution.py` ‚Äî smoke suite that exercises real agent execution using MCP tooling.

### Naming Conventions
- Helper methods follow `_spawn_<thing>` / `_shutdown_<thing>` verbs inside `AgnoAgentProxy`.
- Stored metadata attributes on toolkits use `_automagik_*` prefix to avoid clashing with upstream Agno fields.
- New tests should live under `tests/lib/utils/test_mcp_proxy_lazy_connection.py` (snake_case file names).

## Task Decomposition

### Dependency Graph
```
A[Capture Connection Metadata] --> B[Lazy Connection Wrapper]
B --> C[Resource Lifecycle]
B --> C
C --> D[Testing]
```

### Group A: Capture Connection Metadata (Parallel)
Dependencies: None

**A1-store-params** ‚Äì @lib/utils/proxy_agents.py#L927  
Record server name, include/exclude filters, and transport parameters on each `MCPTools` instance (e.g., `_automagik_params`).  
Success: Subsequent helpers can reconstruct equivalent toolkits without re-parsing YAML.

**A2-doc-assumptions** ‚Äì @genie/wishes/mcp-lazy-connection-wish.md  
Document new lifecycle assumptions inside the wish (this file) so future tasks understand stored metadata usage.  
Success: Wish updated with rationale (fulfilled here).

### Group B: Lazy Connection Wrapper (After A)
Dependencies: A1-store-params

**B1-wrap-entrypoints** ‚Äì @lib/utils/proxy_agents.py#L362  
Replace direct entrypoint invocation with wrappers that spawn a fresh toolkit using stored parameters, reconnect, execute, then hand back results.  
Success: `SearchAgno` tool calls succeed even after event loop restarts.

**B2-error-normalization** ‚Äì @lib/utils/proxy_agents.py#L383  
Enhance error formatting to translate transport exceptions (HTTP status, cancelled scope, etc.) into clear `AgentRunException` messages.  
Success: Failure surfaces as concise ‚ÄúMCP HTTP 500 ‚Ä¶‚Äù responses without stack traces leaking to the user.

### Group C: Resource Lifecycle & Cleanup (After B)
Dependencies: B1-wrap-entrypoints, B2-error-normalization

**C1-shutdown-helpers** ‚Äì @lib/utils/proxy_agents.py#L456  
Create async/sync `_shutdown_mcp_tool` helpers that close sessions quietly after each call to avoid file-descriptor leaks.  
Success: No orphaned MCP sessions remain after repeated tool usage.

**C2-sync-guardrails** ‚Äì @lib/utils/proxy_agents.py#L429  
Handle synchronous wrappers by either creating/awaiting fresh sessions via `asyncio.run` or raising informative errors if code attempts sync execution within a running loop.  
Success: Sync tool consumers fail fast with guidance instead of cryptic loop-state errors.

### Group D: Testing & Validation (After C)
Dependencies: All tasks above

**D1-unit-tests** ‚Äì @tests/lib/utils/test_proxy_agents_coverage.py  
Add targeted tests mocking MCP responses to assert metadata capture, lazy connection, and error normalization.  
Success: `uv run pytest tests/lib/utils/test_proxy_agents_coverage.py -k mcp_lazy` passes.

**D2-integration-tests** ‚Äì @tests/integration/test_agents_real_execution.py  
Extend real agent run tests to call MCP tools twice sequentially, verifying second call reconnects successfully.  
Success: Integration suite green with new assertions.

**D3-death-testament** ‚Äì @genie/reports  
Ensure subsequent Forge agent run captures proof (logs showing reconnection, failing server message).  
Success: Death Testament attached during execution phase (tracked later).

## Implementation Examples

### Lazy Wrapper Sketch
```python
# lib/utils/proxy_agents.py
async def _spawn_fresh_mcp_tool(self, template: MCPTools) -> MCPTools:
    params = copy.deepcopy(getattr(template, "_automagik_params", {}))
    fresh = MCPTools(**params)
    await fresh.connect()
    return fresh
```

### Error Normalization Snippet
```python
def _format_httpx_error(error: httpx.HTTPStatusError) -> str:
    request = error.request
    response = error.response
    detail = response.text or response.reason_phrase
    return f"MCP HTTP {response.status_code} from {request.url}: {detail}".strip()
```

### Post-call Cleanup
```python
async def _shutdown_mcp_tool(self, tool: MCPTools | None) -> None:
    if not tool or not hasattr(tool, "close"):
        return
    try:
        await tool.close()
    except Exception:  # logged upstream
        logger.debug("üåê Ignored MCP shutdown error", exc_info=True)
```

## Testing Protocol
```bash
# Focused unit coverage for proxy helpers
uv run pytest tests/lib/utils/test_proxy_agents_coverage.py -k "mcp_lazy" -q

# Agent execution smoke test (ensures reconnection works twice)
uv run pytest tests/integration/test_agents_real_execution.py -k "template_agent and mcp"

# Static checks
uv run ruff check lib/utils/proxy_agents.py
uv run mypy lib/utils/proxy_agents.py
```

## Validation Checklist
- [ ] Reconnection helpers only trigger during tool execution.
- [ ] Include/exclude filters persist across lazy connections.
- [ ] Errors expose HTTP status or transport detail to the agent response.
- [ ] MCP sessions close after each tool invocation without leaking handles.
- [ ] Unit and integration suites updated with the new lifecycle expectations.
- [ ] Documentation (this wish) reflects all architectural changes.
