# ============================================================
# TEAM CONFIGURATION TEMPLATE
# ============================================================
# Teams coordinate multiple agents to solve complex tasks.
# Agno handles routing and orchestration automatically!
#
# Use teams when:
#   - Different specialists handle different topics
#   - Tasks require multiple perspectives
#   - You want automatic agent selection
# ============================================================

# -----------------------------
# 1. TEAM IDENTITY (Required)
# -----------------------------
team:
  # Unique identifier (lowercase, hyphens)
  name: "my-team"

  # Human-readable description
  description: "Brief description of team purpose"

  # Team mode (determines coordination strategy)
  mode: "route"
  # Options:
  #   - "route"       → Auto-route to best agent (recommended)
  #   - "coordinate"  → Agents collaborate on task
  #   - "collaborate" → Shared goal, parallel work


# -----------------------------
# 2. TEAM MEMBERS (Required)
# -----------------------------
# List agent IDs that are part of this team.
# Each agent should be defined in separate agent config files.
# -----------------------------
members:
  - "agent-1"  # Replace with actual agent IDs
  - "agent-2"
  - "agent-3"


# -----------------------------
# 3. ROUTING INSTRUCTIONS (Required)
# -----------------------------
# Tell the team HOW to route queries to agents.
# Be specific about what each agent handles.
# -----------------------------
instructions: |
  You are a team coordinator that routes queries to specialist agents.

  Routing rules:
  - Route [topic A] questions to agent-1
  - Route [topic B] questions to agent-2
  - Route [topic C] questions to agent-3

  Guidelines:
  - Analyze the user's query carefully
  - Choose the most appropriate specialist
  - Forward the complete context
  - If uncertain, ask for clarification


# -----------------------------
# 4. TEAM MODEL (Optional)
# -----------------------------
# Model used by the team coordinator for routing decisions.
# Usually fast models work best (routing is simple).
# -----------------------------
model: "gpt-4o-mini"


# -----------------------------
# 5. STORAGE (Optional)
# -----------------------------
# Team-level conversation storage
# -----------------------------
storage:
  type: "postgres"
  connection: "${HIVE_DATABASE_URL}"
  table_name: "my_team_sessions"


# -----------------------------
# 6. ADVANCED SETTINGS (Optional)
# -----------------------------
settings:
  # Show which agent handled each query
  show_routing: true

  # Enable streaming responses
  stream: true

  # Debug mode (shows routing decisions)
  debug_mode: false


# ============================================================
# TEAM MODE EXAMPLES
# ============================================================
#
# MODE: "route" (Automatic Routing)
# ----------------------------------
# Best for: Specialist teams, support routing, domain experts
# How it works:
#   1. User asks question
#   2. Team analyzes and selects best agent
#   3. Agent processes and responds
#   4. Response goes back to user
#
# Example: Customer support team
#   - billing-agent (handles payment issues)
#   - technical-agent (handles technical issues)
#   - sales-agent (handles product questions)
#
#
# MODE: "coordinate" (Collaborative)
# ----------------------------------
# Best for: Complex tasks, multiple perspectives, brainstorming
# How it works:
#   1. User provides task
#   2. Multiple agents analyze and contribute
#   3. Team synthesizes responses
#   4. Unified answer to user
#
# Example: Product strategy team
#   - market-researcher
#   - data-analyst
#   - business-strategist
#
#
# MODE: "collaborate" (Parallel Work)
# -----------------------------------
# Best for: Independent subtasks, parallel processing
# How it works:
#   1. Task divided into subtasks
#   2. Agents work simultaneously
#   3. Results combined
#   4. Final output delivered
#
# Example: Content creation team
#   - writer (creates draft)
#   - editor (reviews content)
#   - seo-optimizer (optimizes for search)
#

# REAL-WORLD TEAM EXAMPLES
# ============================================================
#
# 1. CUSTOMER SUPPORT ROUTER
# ---------------------------
# team:
#   name: "support-router"
#   mode: "route"
# members:
#   - "billing-specialist"
#   - "technical-specialist"
#   - "account-manager"
# instructions: |
#   Route to billing-specialist: payments, invoices, refunds
#   Route to technical-specialist: bugs, integrations, API
#   Route to account-manager: upgrades, contracts, sales
#
#
# 2. RESEARCH TEAM
# ----------------
# team:
#   name: "research-team"
#   mode: "coordinate"
# members:
#   - "web-researcher"
#   - "data-analyst"
#   - "report-writer"
# instructions: |
#   Collaborate to produce comprehensive research reports.
#   - web-researcher: Find sources and gather data
#   - data-analyst: Analyze trends and patterns
#   - report-writer: Synthesize into clear report
#
#
# 3. CODE REVIEW TEAM
# --------------------
# team:
#   name: "code-review-team"
#   mode: "collaborate"
# members:
#   - "security-reviewer"
#   - "performance-reviewer"
#   - "style-reviewer"
# instructions: |
#   Review code in parallel for:
#   - security-reviewer: Security vulnerabilities
#   - performance-reviewer: Performance bottlenecks
#   - style-reviewer: Code style and best practices
#
# ============================================================


# ============================================================
# TIPS FOR GREAT TEAMS
# ============================================================
#
# 1. Clear Specialization
#    - Each agent should have a distinct role
#    - Avoid overlapping responsibilities
#    - Make routing rules unambiguous
#
# 2. Good Team Size
#    - Route mode: 2-5 agents (keeps routing simple)
#    - Coordinate mode: 2-3 agents (too many = chaos)
#    - Collaborate mode: 2-4 agents (parallel limit)
#
# 3. Routing Instructions
#    - Be specific about what triggers each agent
#    - Include examples of typical queries
#    - Handle edge cases (unclear queries)
#
# 4. Testing
#    - Test with representative queries
#    - Verify correct agent selection
#    - Check response quality
#
# 5. Performance
#    - Use fast models for routing (gpt-4o-mini)
#    - Keep team size reasonable
#    - Enable streaming for better UX
